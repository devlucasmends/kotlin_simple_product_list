# Simple Product List App

## Project Description
This repository contains a simple project developed in Kotlin, created for the purpose of learning and practicing the basic concepts of the language. It is an app that allows users to create and manage a product list. Despite its simplicity, the project is an excellent way to explore list handling, data manipulation, and user interaction in an Android environment.

The main goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience with Kotlin, making it easier to understand how to build basic app functionalities. The application also serves as an introductory example of how to organize code, handle events, and manage state in an Android project.

## Features
- **Add Products**: Allows users to insert new products into the list easily.
- **View Product List**: Displays the added products, enabling users to track their entries.
- **Clear List**: Provides a functionality to remove all items from the list, allowing users to start fresh.

This project was created as a practical exercise, focusing on reinforcing fundamental programming concepts in Kotlin, such as list handling, event management, and implementing basic logic.
